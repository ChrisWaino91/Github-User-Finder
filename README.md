This app uses GitHubs own API to pull information back on the user that has been searched for. 

This will automatically search as soon as a key is pressed, for example:

If you type, "ChrisWaino91", the app will search for "c" then "ch" then "chr" as it is being typed. This is by design for learning purposes but does cause the free api to hit its limit pretty quickly.

If the app stops working - it will be because the API Key has hit it's limit. Inspect > Console > 403 Response on the API request to see this for yourself.
